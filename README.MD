"Online Interactive PDF Lecture Slide Viewer" is a project for the course CS3003S at UCT in South Africa. The task is to allow lecturers to upload PDF files (lectures) which can be commented on by students. The background is (very roughly) that data can be collected by the lecturer relating to how the notes are being consumed. This should allow the lecturer to make informed decisions, which would hopefully translate to better learning for the students.
